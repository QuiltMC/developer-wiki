# Quilt Developer Wiki

----

## FAQ:

### What is this wiki?
This wiki is specifically for developers, not users, of Quilt to learn how to make mods

### What makes this wiki different from other wikis?
Each loader has their own wiki [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/doku.php) and [Forge](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/). 
While Forge's wiki is has a better design for modders than Fabric's, 
which often has outdated tutorials or hard to find tutorials for old versions and is not managed through git, 
they both lack one critical feature that would bring them to the next level: **Real code**. 

This wiki is built off of 3 core principles: 
* Real, compiled code.
* Tutorials for multiple versions.
* Ease to add new features. 

To achieve these, a custom gradle plugin was developed to create this wiki.
