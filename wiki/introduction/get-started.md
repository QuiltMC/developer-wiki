# Getting started with Quilt

## Basic requirements

In order to start modding Minecraft, you'll need to know a couple things.

- Basic Java knowledge. This includes understanding its syntax, object oriented
  programming, and some essential design patterns.
- Basic [Git](https://git-scm.com/) knowledge. While technically not necessary, it'll
  make your life a lot easier. This includes understanding how to clone repositories
  and make commits.

## How to use this wiki

examples category have associated sub-pages, which are supplementary. Most pages will
contain code snippets, with full examples provided in
[the example code repository](https://example.com).

## How to learn modding, for beginners

Minecraft modding can get complicated. We aim to provide a resource to help you learn
fundamental modding concepts. However, there are some things that we can't do and
expect you to do on your own to learn.

Asking questions properly, whether it be on our forum or on Discord, is an essential
skill to have. Never be afraid to ask questions, we're always willing to help and we
don't judge.

TODO: Methodology for asking questions here

Many problems have been solved in modding before, and are publicly available for you
to see and use as most mods for Quilt are open source. We recommend that you look at
examples of how to do things in open source repositories and sometimes "steal" code.
Open source repositories are there for you to learn from and use, don't be afraid of
them!
